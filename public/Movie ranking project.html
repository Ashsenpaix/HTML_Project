<h1>Ranking The Best Jojo's Bizzare Adventure Character According to Aish</h1>
<h2>The top 3 best jojo character (not including the manga)</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Jotaro Kujo</h3>
<p> Not surprising, it's the most popular and the face of JJBA none other than jotaro kuja!, who is the main character of part 3 where he defeated probably the greatest vampire, DIO! the fight between sta platinum and za warudo is one of the iconic fights in the history of anime.</p>
<h3>Joseph Joestar</h3>
<p>Joseph! who is the funniest of all joestars and probably has the strogest plot armor too lol, he would have definately been my number one if only he didn't cheat on Suzi Q, but then again we wouldn't be blessed with part 4 if it wasn't for that.</p>
<h3>Giorno Giovanna</h3>
<p>The son of Dio and jonathan? Giorno is such a great character with a stand like golden experience who also achieved requiem, part 5 has so many cool stands and not the mention that part 5 has amazing side characters too.</p>
